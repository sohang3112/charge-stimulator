**PHYSICS CHARGE STIMULATOR**

Redoing physics charge stimulator in HTML+JS (and some CSS), 
since the last one (done in C++ using SFML) was quite buggy and had no UI at all.

*Changes Planned:*
- Use more functional style
- Interactive model, where users can change things any time

*Difficulties Foreseen:*
- Problem of very high speeds when particles are attracted and rushing towards each other
  (velocity is so high that they overshoot each other)


**SERVER CODE**
- User sign up / sign in
- Create / Edit / Save files representing system of charges (format: JSON)
